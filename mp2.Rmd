load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
candidate_contribution_2 <- merge.data.frame(candidates, contributions, by = "cand_id", all = TRUE)

Candidate_contribution_tidy_2 <- candidate_contribution_2 %>% filter(candidates %in% c("CO", "NV", "NM", "WI", "OH", "VA", "NC", "FL", "PA", "NH")) %>% filter(contributions %in% c("CO", "NV", "NM", "WI", "OH", "VA", "NC", "FL", "PA", "NH"))
